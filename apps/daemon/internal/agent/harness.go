// Package agent defines the Runtime's native Harness adapter contract.
// Start with this file when adding a Harness; the onboarding guide is at
// contracts/agents-api/harness-onboarding.md.
//
// Required lifecycle: ExecutorFactory prepares a fixed Session-owned Executor;
// each StartTurn returns a fresh Turn with its own output and settlement.
// Turn includes the public text DurableSteerer requirement. Keep extension
// interfaces separate, but implement each explicitly: unsupported operations
// return ErrUnsupportedOperation before any native effects. Interface presence
// does not advertise support; the capability declaration controls admission. MCP,
// images, structured output and Subagent observations use protocol messages
// rather than additional Go interfaces; qualify and advertise them separately.
//
// Registration: each adapter exports one Declaration. The Runtime discovers the
// static declaration list and installs each resulting Runtime through Register.
// Availability and factory selection belong to the adapter. RegisterKind resets
// the factories, so Register installs it first. RegisterExecutor derives the
// Preparation capability; the adapter declares WorkspaceReadPreparation.
//
// Runtime registration and Core service qualification remain separate. A public
// Harness also needs a profile in services/core/internal/engine; advertising
// a capability cannot authorize it. Requests, events and capability descriptors
// use the existing internal/agentdaemon/proto types. An Environment execution
// request carries the Runtime's bound workspace directory in
// LocalEnvironment.WorkspaceRoot; the native Harness runs there.
