// Package sessions owns the Session vocabulary: Sessions, Turns and their
// statuses, inputs, Environments and their provisioning failures, function
// calls, Item and Artifact reads, executor credentials, and the errors Session
// operations return. It also decides what Session writes publish: the public
// changes that report Turn and Session transitions, what a Turn that ends
// settles, measured Turn usage and the Session activity each change reports.
// The Session writes that several operations share are procedures here, over
// the transaction interfaces declared beside them: cancelling work, failing
// and terminating an Environment, tracking input activity, the admission
// gates, admitting an input batch, moving a Turn's status, admitting a function
// result, reading a Turn's required actions, appending to a Turn's execution
// journal and projecting its observations and admitted inputs into Items, Turn
// usage and Subagents. Service runs the pooled Session use cases, such as
// staging a Turn's Artifacts, over Storage, and Reader declares the Session
// reads. ExecutionOperations runs the Session writes only the execution owner
// makes, such as moving and completing Turns, recording function calls and
// their application receipts and journaling a Turn's observations, over the
// lease-bound ExecutionStorage.
